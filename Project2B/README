QUESTION 2B.1A: SortedList_insert, SortedList_lookup grows
as the list get bigger. Hence the worker thread is O(N^2),
and the time per operation grows linearly, in general.

QUESTION 2B.1B: Use a different data structure, like a heap.
Insert/lookup/delete will be O(logN), so the time per operation
will grows very slowly.

QUESTIONS 2B.2A: Same as Graph 2 in Project 1A, spin-lock is
slower as the number of threads increase.
Reason:
Imagine the case where the thread holding 
the lock is pre-empted within a critical section. The 
scheduler might then run every other thread (imagine 
there are N âˆ’ 1 others), each of which tries to acquire
the lock. In this case, each of those threads will spin 
for the duration of a time slice before giving up the CPU.
