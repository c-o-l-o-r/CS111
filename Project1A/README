Limitations:
	Anything wrong happens to the shell is interpreted as 
	"EOF Received from Shell". So when C-D is pressed, to 
	prevent that happens, flag_shell_eof_disable is set.
	
	Cannots handle very long input in --shell options.
	For some reason, realloc works when there is no
	options, but it doesn't work in --shell options,
	with the error: realloc(): invalid next size. So to
	prevent that happens, the initial buffer is set at 
	1000.
